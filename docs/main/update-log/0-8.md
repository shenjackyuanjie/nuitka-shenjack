# Nuitka Release 0.8

This release has a massive amount of bug fixes, builds on existing features, and adds new ones.

## Bug Fixes

* Windows: Fix, need to ignore cases where shorting in path for external use during compilation gives an permission error. Fixed in 0.7.1 already.
* Compatibility: Added workaround for `scipy.stats` function copying. Fixed in 0.7.1 already.
* Windows: Fix, detect ARM64 arch of MSVC properly, such that we can give a proper mismatch for the Python architecture. Fixed in 0.7.1 already.
* Standalone: Fix, using `importlib.metadata` module failed to include `email` from standard library parts no longer included by default. Fixed in 0.7.1 already.
* macOS: Fix, the dependency parser was using normalized paths where original paths must be used. Fixed in 0.7.1 already.
* Standalone: Fix, using `shiboken6` module (mostly due to `PySide6`) failed to include `argparse` from the standard library from standard library parts no longer included by default. Fixed in 0.7.1 already.
* Onefile: Fix, the detection of a usable Python for compression could crash. Fixed in 0.7.2 already.
* Onefile: Adding the payload on Windows could run into locks still being held, need to wait in that case. Fixed in 0.7.2 already.
* Fix, need to include `pkg_resources` as well, we need it for when we use Jinja2, which is more often now. For Python3 this was fixed in 0.7.3 already. Later a version to use with Python2 was added as well.
* Release: The wheels built for Nuitka when installed through URLs were not version specific, but due to different inline copies per OS and Python version, they must not be reused. Therefore we now pretend to contain an extension module, which handles that. Fixed in 0.7.3 already.
* Standalone: Fix, using `urllib.requests` module failed to include `http.client` from standard library parts no longer included by default. Fixed in 0.7.3 already. Later `http.cookiejar` was added too.
* Standalone: Do not compress MSVC run time library when using `upx` plugin, that is not going to work. Fixed in 0.7.4 already.
* Standalone: Fix, on Windows more files should be included for TkInter to work with all software. Fixed in 0.7.5 already.
* Distutils: Added support for `package_dir` directive to specify where source code lives. Fixed in 0.7.6 already.
* Standalone: Fix, using `shelve` module failed to include `dbm` from standard library parts no longer included by default. Fixed in 0.7.6 already.
* Standalone: Added support for `arcade` data files. Fixed in 0.7.7 already.
* Standalone: Fix, bytecode demotions should use relative filenames rather than original ones. Fixed in 0.7.7 already.
* Standalone: Fix, must remove extension module objects from `sys.modules` before executing an extension module that will create it. This fixes cases of cyclic dependencies from modules loaded by the extension module.
* Windows: In case of an exception, `clcache` was itself triggering one during its handling, hiding the real exception behind a `TypeError`.
* Windows: Improved `clcache` locking behavior, avoiding a race. Also increase characters used for key from 2 to 3 chars, making collisions far more rare.
* Standalone: Added support for `persistent` package.
* Standalone: Added support for newer `tensorflow` package.
* Module: Fix, need to restore the `__file__` and `__spec__` values of top level module. It is changed by CPython after import to an incompatible file name, and not our loader, preventing package resources to be found.
* Standalone: Added support for `Crpytodome.Cipher.PKCS1_v1_5`.
* Fix, `pkgutil.iter_modules` without arguments was not working properly with our meta path based loader.
* Windows: Fix, could crash on when the Scons report was written due to directories in `PATH` that failed to encode.
* Compatibility: Fix, positive `divmod` and modulo `%` with negative remainders of positive floats was not correct.
* Fix, `str.encode` with only `errors` value, but default value for encoding was crashing the compilation.
* Python3.10+: Fix, `match` statement sliced values must be lists, not tuples.
* Standalone: Added support for newer `glfw` and `OpenGL` packages.
* Python3: Fix, failed to read bytecode only stdlib files. This affect mostly Fedora Python which does this for encodings.
* Python3.5+: Fix, two phase loading of modules could release it immediately.
* Standalone: Added missing dependency for `pydantic`.
* Fix, the `str.split` rejected default `sep` value with only `maxsplit` given as a keyword argument.
* Standalone: Added missing dependency of `wsgiref` module.
* Standalone: Added support for `falcon` module.
* Standalone: Added support for `eliot` module.
* Fix, need to mark assigned from variables as escaped. Without it, some aliased loop variables could be misunderstood and falsely statically optimized.
* Standalone: Added support for newer `uvicorn` package.
* Standalone: Added data files for the `accessible_output2`, `babel`, `frozendict`, and `sound_lib` package.
* Standalone: Added support for newer `sklearn` package.
* Standalone: Added support for `tkinterdnd2` package.
* Python3.7+: Fix, the error message wasn’t fully compatible for unsubscriptable type exception messages.
* Standalone: Fix, `idlelib` from stdlib was always ignored.
* Python3.4+: Fix, the `__spec__.origin` as produced by `find_spec` of our meta path based loader, didn’t have the correct `origin` attribute value.
* Standalone: Disable QtPDF plugin of PySide 6.3.0, because it’s failing dependency checks. On macOS this was blocking, we will change it to detection if that is necessary in a future release.
* Standalone: Added support for `orderedmultidict`.
* Standalone: Added support for `clr` module.
* Standalone: Added support for newer `cv2` package.

## New Features

* Added new option `--module-name-choice` to select what value `__name__` and `__package__` are going to be. With `--module-name-choice=runtime` (default for `--module` mode), the created module uses the parent package to deduce the value of `__package__`, to be fully compatible. The value `--module-name-choice=original` (default for other modes) allows for more static optimization to happen.
* Added support for `get_resource_reader` to our meta path based loader. This allows to avoid useless temporary files in case `importlib.resources.path` is used, due to a bad interaction with the fallback implementation used without it.
* Added support for `--force-stdout-spec```and<span> ``--force-stderr-spec` on all platforms, this was previously limited to Windows.
* Added support for requiring and suggesting modes. In part this was added to 0.7.3 already, and is used e.g. to enforce that on macOS the `wx` will only work as a GUI program and crash unless `--disable-console` is specified. These will warn the user or outright error the compilation if something is known to be needed or useful.
* Debian: Detect version information for “Debian Sid”. Added in 0.7.4 already, and also improved how Debian/Ubuntu versions are output.
* Added new option `--noinclude-data-files` to instruct Nuitka to not include data files matching patterns given. Also attached loggers and tags to included data file and include them in the compilation report.
* Distutils: When using `pyproject.toml` without `setup.py` so far it was not possible to pass arguments. This is now possible by adding a section like this.

  > ```toml title="pyproject.toml"
  > [nuitka]
  > # options without an argument are passed as boolean value
  > show-scons = true
  > 
  > # options with single values, e.g. enable a plugin of Nuitka
  > enable-plugin = pyside2
  > 
  > # options with several values, e.g. avoiding including modules, accepts
  > # list argument.
  > nofollow-import-to = ["*.tests", "*.distutils"]
  > ```

  The option names are the same, but without leading dashes. Lists are only needed when passing multiple values with the same option.
* macOS: Add support for specifying signing identity with `--macos-sign-identity` and access to protected resources `--macos-app-protected-resource`.
* Included data files are now reported in the compilation report XML as well.
* Accept absolute paths for searching paths of binaries. This allows e.g. the `upx` plugin to accept both a folder path and the full path including the binary name to work when you specify the binary location with `--upx-binary` making it more user friendly.
* Python3.10: Added support for positional matching of classes, so far only keyword matching was working.
* Added support for path spec values `%CACHE_DIR`, `%COMPANY%`, `%PRODUCT%`, `%VERSION%`, and `%HOME` in preparation of onefile once again being able to be cached and not unpacked repeatedly for each execution.
* Standalone: Detect missing `tk-inter` plugin at run time. When TCL fails to load, it then outputs a more helpful error. This ought to be done for all plugins, where it’s not clear if they are needed.
* Anti-Bloat: Added support for plain replacements in the `anti-bloat.yml` file. Before with `replacement`, the new value had to be produced by an `eval`, which makes for less readable values due to extra quoting. for plain values.

## Optimization

* Python3.10+: Added support for `ordered-set` PyPI package to speed up compilation on these versions too, adding a warning if no accelerated form of `OrderedSet` is used, but believed to be usable.
* Optimization: Added `bytes.decode` operations. This is only a start and we needed this for internal usage, more should follow later.
* Much more `anti-bloat` work was added. Avoiding `ipython`, `unittest`, and sometimes even `doctest` usage for some more packages.
* The `ccache` was not always used, sometimes it believed to catch a potential race, that we need to tell it to ignore. This will speed up re-compilation of the C side in many cases.
* Do not compile the meta path based loader separate, which allows us to not expose functions and values only used by it. Also spares the C compiler one file.
* Added various dedicated nodes for querying package resources data, e.g. `pkgutil.get_data`. This will make it easier to detect cases of missing data files in the future.
* Added more hard imports, some of which help scalability in the compilation, because these are then known to exist in standalone mode, others are used for package resource specific operations.
* Onefile: Releasing decompression buffers avoiding unnecessary high memory usage of bootstrap binary.
* Standalone: Avoid proving directories with no DLLs (e.g. from packages) towards `ldd`, this should avoid exceeding command line limits.
* For `clcache` remove writing of the stats file before Scons has completed, which avoids IO and locking churn.
* Standalone: Avoid including `wsgiref` from stdlib by default.

## Cleanups

* Removed references to `chrpath` and dead code around it, it was still listed as a dependency, although we stopped using it a while ago.
* Removed uses of `anti-bloat` in examples and tests, it is now enabled by default.
* Made standard plugin file naming consistent, their name should be `*Plugin.py`.
* Cleaned up `tensorflow` plugin. The source modification was moved to `anti-bloat` where it is easy to do. The implicit dependencies are now in the config file of `implicit-imports` plugin.
* Massive cleanups of data file handling in plugins. Adding methods for producing the now required objects.
* The Scons file handling got further cleaned up and unified, doing more things in common code.
* Avoid `#ifdefs` usages with new helper function `Nuitka_String_FromFormat` that implies them for more readable code.
* Split the allowance check from the encountering. Allow plugins and options all to say if an import should be followed, and only when that is decided, to complain about it. Previously the attempt was causing an error, even if another plugin were to decide against it later.
* Python2.6: Avoid warnings from MSVC for out specialized `long` code. In testing it worked correctly, but this is more explicit and doesn’t rely on C implementation specific behavior, although it appears to be universal.

## Organisational

* UI: Warning tests are now wrapped to multiple lines if necessary. That makes it more accessible for larger messages that contain more guiding information.
* Documented how to use local Nuitka checkout with `pyproject.toml` files, this makes debugging Nuitka straightforward in these setups.
* Added instructions on how to pass extra C and linker flags and to the User Manual.
* Made our auto-format usable for the Nuitka website code too.
* Removed dependencies on `chrpath` and the now dead code that would use it, we are happy with `patchelf`.
* Updated to latest versions of requirements for development, esp. `black` and `pylint`.
* Renamed `--macos-onefile-icon` to `--macos-app-icon` because that is what it is really used for.
* Unified how dependencies are installed in GitHub actions.
* Updated man page contents for option name changes from last releases.
* Updated the MinGW64 winlibs download used on Windows to the latest version.
* Updated the `ccache` binary used on Windows with MinGW64. This is in preparation of using it potentially for MSVC as well.
* Updated Visual Code C config to use Python3.10 and MSVC 2022 include paths.

## Tests

* Better outputs from standalone library compilation test, esp. when finding a problem, present the script to reproduce it immediately.
* Enhanced generated tests to cover `str` methods to use keyword arguments.
* Added automatic execution of `pyproject.toml` driven test case.
* Enhanced output in case of `optimization` test failures, dumping what value is there that has not become a compile time constant.

## Summary

This release has seen a lot of consolidation. The plugins layer for data files is now all powerful, allowing much nicer handling of them by the plugins, they are better reported in normal output, and they are also part of the report file that Nuitka can create. You may now also inhibit their inclusion from the command line, if you decide otherwise.

The `pyproject.toml` now supporting Nuitka arguments is closing an important gap.

Generally many features got more polished, e.g. non-automatic inclusion of stdlib modules has most problems fixed up.

An important area of improvement, are the hard imports. These will be used to replace the source based resolution of package requirements with ones that are proper nodes in the tree. Getting these hard imports to still retain full compatibility with existing imports, that are more or less `__import__` uses only, was revealing quite a bit of technical debt, that has been addressed with this release.

For onefile, the cached mode is being prepared with the variables added, but will only be in a later release.

Also a bunch of new or upgraded packages are working now, and the push for `anti-bloat` work has increased, making many compilations even more lean, but scalability is still an issue.
