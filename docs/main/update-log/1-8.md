# Nuitka Release 1.8

## Bug Fixes

* Standalone: Added support for `opentelemetry` package. Added in 1.7.1 already.
* Reports: Fix, do not report plugin influence when there are not `no-auto-follow` in an anti-bloat section. Fixed in 1.7.2 already.
* Anti-Bloat: Add missing usage tag `use_pytest` for anti-bloat changes that remove `pytest` related codes. Fixed in 1.7.2 already.
* Standalone: Added support for newer `jsonschema` package. Fixed in 1.7.2 already.
* Standalone: Fix, our `iterdir` implementation was crashing in `files` for packages that don’t actually have a directory for data files to live in. Fixed in 1.7.2 already.
* Fix, parent package imports could pick the wrong name internally and then collide with sub-packages of that package during collision. Fixed in 1.7.3 already.
* Standalone: Added support for `pymssql` package. Fixed in 1.7.3 already.
* Standalone: Added support for `cvxpy` package. Fixed in 1.7.4 already.
* Standalone: Added missing dependencies of `lib2to3.refactor`. Fixed in 1.7.4 already.
* Standalone: Fix, data files for `lib2to3.pgen` were regressed. Fixed in 1.7.4 already.
* Standalone: Added missing dependency of `cairo` package. Fixed in 1.7.4 already.
* Standalone: Added support for new `trio` package. Fixed in 1.7.4 already.
* Standalone: Added support for `markdown` package. Fixed in 1.7.4 already.
* Standalone: Added support to `eventlet` package. Fixed in 1.7.4 already.
* Standalone: Added support for more newer `sklearn` package. Fixed in 1.7.5 already.
* Standalone: Added support for more newer `skimage` package. Fixed in 1.7.5 already.
* Standalone: Added support for more newer `transformers` package. Fixed in 1.7.5 already.
* Standalone: Added support for `torch_scatter` package. Fixed in 1.7.6 already.
* Standalone: Added missing DLL for `wx.html2` to work well on Windows. Fixed in 1.7.6 already.
* Fix, the `@pyqtSlot` decoration could crash the compilation and was effective even if no pyqt plugin was active. Fixed in 1.7.6 already.
* Python3.11: Fix, need to support `BaseExceptionGroup` for code generation too, otherwise the `exceptiongroup` backport was not working. Fixed in 1.7.7 already.
* MSYS2: Fix usage of deprecated `sysconfig` variable with mingw. After their switch to Python 3.11, it is no longer available. Fixed in 1.7.7 already.
* Distutils: Do not compile empty directories found in package scan as namespaces. Fixed in 1.7.7 already.
* Python3.7+: Fix, need to follow dict internal structure more correctly, otherwise we over-allocate and copy more data than necessary. Fixed in 1.7.7 already.
* Python3.8: Fix, the new pyqt plugin workaround requires 3.9 or higher and could causes compile time crashes with the `@pyqtSlot` decorator. Fixed in 1.7.7 already.
* Modules: Fix, the `.pyi` file created was using default encoding which can vary and potentially even crash on other systems. Enforcing `utf-8` now. Fixed in 1.7.8 already.
* Fix, only failed relative imports should become package relative. This was giving wrong names for attempts imports in these cases. Mostly only affected dependency caching correctness and reporting at this time. Fixed in 1.7.8 already.
* Standalone: Added missing metadata dependencies for `transformers` package. Fixed in 1.7.9 already, but more added for release.
* Fix, need to ignore folders that cannot be module names in stdlib. Could e.g. crash when encountering folders like `.idea` which cannot be module names. Fixed in 1.7.9 already.
* Standalone: Added data files for `langchain` package. Fixed in 1.7.10 already.
* Fix, forced output paths didn’t work without C11 mode. This mainly affected older MSVC users, with newer MSVC and good enough Windows SDK, it’s not using C++ anymore. Fixed in 1.7.10 already.
* Fix, was using int values for boolean returns, something that was giving warnings with at least older MSVC not in C11 mode. Fixed in 1.7.10 already.
* Fix, failed hard name imports could crash with segfault trying to release their value. Fixed in 1.7.10 already.
* Standalone: Added missing implicit dependency for `xml.sax` in stdlib. Fixed in 1.7.10 already.
* Windows: Fix, `--mingw64` mode was not working if MSVC was installed, but not acceptable for use. Fixed in 1.7.10 already.
* Standalone: Fix, `onnxruntime` had too few DLLs included. Fixed in 1.7.10 already.
* Standalone: Added support for `moviepy`. Fixed in 1.7.10 already.
* Python3.10+: Fix, matching empty sequences was not considering length, leading to incorrect code execution for that case.

  > ```python title="match.py"
  > match x:
  >    case []:
  >          ... # non-empty sequences matched here
  > ```

* UI: Fix, some error outputs didn’t work nicely with progress bars, need to use our own print function that temporarily disables them or else outputs get corrupted.
* Linux: Sync output for data composer. This is to avoid race conditions that we might have been seeing occasionally.
* Compatibility: Fix, the `sys.flags.optimize` value for `--python-flag=-OO` didn’t match what Python does.
* Standalone: Fix, packages have no `__file__` if imported from frozen, these was causing issues for some packages that scan all modules and expect those to be there.
* Fix, the `dict` built-in could crash if its argument self-destructs during usage.
* Fix, the `PySide2/PySide6` workaround for connecting compiled class methods without crashing were not handling its optional `type` argument.
* Enhanced non-commercial PySide2 support by adding yet another class to be hooked. This was ironically contributed by a commercial user.
* Standalone: Added support for newer `delvewheel` version as used in newest `scipy` and probably more packages in the future.
* Compatibility: The `pkgutil.iter_modules` function now works without importing the module first. The makes `Faker` work on Windows as well.
* Reports: Detect top level packages even with broken packaging. Some packages will not reveal through installed files or top level what package they are for, and as a result, they cannot be uninstalled, but we need to still be able guess what package they are responsible for, so we go by their PyPI name, which works for `tensorflow`.
* Compatibility: More robust way of allowing iteration of compiled packages via file path.
  Rather than pre-populating the cache, we should provide the hook function to check if we are responsible for a given path. With this, the `Faker` package works on Windows as well now, and probably other packages benefit too. This then works on paths rather than strings, which due to short paths, etc. can be non-unique on Windows easily.
* Standalone: Added support for the `opencc` package.
* Compatibility: Fix, import name resolving done for things like `six` and others should be done as soon as possible, and not just during optimization, or else some imports can become just wrong as a result.
* Python3.11: Added support for the new `closure` keyword only argument in `exec` built-in.
* Standalone: Added support for `pythonnet` on Linux as well.
* Debian: Fix, do not give false alarms for root pip installed packages, they get a similar path component, but are not actually Debian packages of course, this was mostly affecting builds inside containers of course.
* Compatibility: Added support for comparing results from our resource reader file interfaces. This is needed for when people want to e.g. sort the the file list.
* Python3.6+: Fix, didn’t catch `await` on module level as a syntax error.
* Compatibility: Added support for `joblib` with `loky` backend as well.
* Standalone: Added support for newer `chromadb` adding missing dependencies and data files.
* Python3.9+: Fix, `importlib.resources.files()` was not fully compatible
  Need to provide basename for `.name` attribute rather than an absolute path. And in some cases, a leading trailing slashes was produced for the full path, which caused trouble for file iteration of filenames.
* Standalone: Added support for newer `importlib_resources` as well. We now need to expose the `files` functionality even before Python 3.9 for this to be possible.
* Standalone: Added support for newer `rapidfuzz` package.
* Added support for newer `PyOpenGL` package.

## New Features

* Plugins: Added support to specify embedding of metadata for given packages via the package configuration. With this, entry points, version, etc. can even be resolved if not currently possible at compile time to so through the code with static optimization. Added in 1.7.1 already.

  > ```yaml title="standard.nuitka-package.config.yml"
  > - module-name: 'opentelemetry.propagate'
  >   data-files:
  >     include-metadata:
  >       - 'opentelemetry-api'
  > ```

* Distutils: Add PEP 660 editable install support. With this `pdm` can be used for building wheels with Nuitka compilation. Added in 1.7.8 already.
* Haiku: Added support for accelerated mode, standalone will need more work, also recognize its form of the `site-packages` folder, named `vendor-packages`.
* Disable misleading initial import exception handling in `numpy`, all what it says detracts only.
* Added python flags given for `no_asserts`, `no_docstrings` and `no_annotations` to the `__compiled__` attribute values of modules and functions to fully expose the information.
* Watch: Added capability to specify what `nuitka` binary to use in `nuitka-watch` so we can use enhanced `nuitka-watch` from develop branch with older versions of Nuitka with no issues.
* Watch: Now evaluates the minimum version needed for Nuitka, and skips test cases, allowing `nuitka-watch` to be run with versions that do not yet handle cases that e.g. develop already can, i.e. next Nuitka version.
* Watch: Now evaluates if a compilation with Nuitka needs to be done at all, as it’s only necessary if the PyPI config changed, or if Nuitka version changed.
* Reports: Added source path for modules, so it’s easier to tell where something came from, and esp. in case of bugs in the import location of Nuitka.
* Reports: In case of a crash, always write report file for use in bug reporting. This is now done even if no report was asked for.
* Reports: Include error exit message from Nuitka in case of explicit exits.
* UI: Added new `--deployment` and `--no-deployment-flag` that disables certain debugging helpers.
  Right now, we use this to control a hook that prevents execution of itself with `-c` which is used by e.g. `joblib` and that potentially can turns Nuitka created programs into a fork bombs, when they use `sys.executable<span> -c<span> ...`. This can be disabled with `--no-deployment-flag=self-execution` or `--deployment`.
  The plan is to expand this to cover `FileNotFoundError` and similar exception exits pointing to compilation issues with helpful more annotations.
* Catch attempts to exec compiled function bytecodes.
  This segfaults otherwise with at least Python3.11 and is probably a good idea to catch for all versions, as it doesn’t do anything.
* Windows: Remove unnecessary `.\` in CMD files generated, these will otherwise show up in `sys.argv[0]` too, making them more ugly than necessary.
* Scons: Also respect `CFLAGS` setting. It’s rarely used, but for completeness sake we should have that too. The effects are the same as `CCFLAGS` it seems.

## Optimization

* Added type shape for built-in hash operation, these must indeed be of `int` type either way.
* Anti-Bloat: Avoid using `unittest` in `future` and `multiprocessing` package. Added in 1.7.3 already.
* Anti-Bloat: Avoid using `unittest` in `git` package. Added in 1.7.3 already.
* Anti-Bloat: Avoid `IPython` in `streamlit` package.
* Standalone: Make `transformers` work with `no_docstrings` mode. Added in 1.7.7 already.
* Anti-Bloat: Avoid more `IPython` usage in `transformers` package.
* Anti-Bloat: Avoid using `pytest` in `polyfactory` package.
* Anti-Bloat: Expand the list of modules that are in the `unittest` group by the ones Python provides itself, `test.support`, `test.test_support` and `future.moves.test.support`, so the culprits are more easily recognizable.
* Anti-Bloat: Treat `ipykernel` and `jupyter_client` as equal to IPython for usage, so the bloat warning about IPython becomes more meaningful in that case too.
* Anti-Bloat: Avoid using `IPython` in `plumbum` package.
* Statically optimize the value of `sys.byteorder` as well.
* Anti-Bloat: Added `no-auto-follow` for `tornado` in `joblib` package. The user is informed of that happening if nothing else imports tornado in case he wants to enable it.
* Standalone: Avoid including standard library `zipapp` or `calendar` automatically and remove their runners through `anti-bloat` configuration. This got rid of `argparse` for hello world compilation.
* Standalone: Do not auto include standard library `json.tool` which is a binary only.
* Standalone: Avoid automatic inclusion a `_json` extension module for the `json` module and do not automatically include it as part of stdlib anymore, this can reduce the size of standalone distributions.
* Standalone: Avoid the standard library `audioop` extension module by making all audio related modules non-automatically included.
* Standalone: Avoid the `_contextvars` standard library extension module. Explicit and implicit imports of `contextvar` module will continue to work and hopefully give proper errors until we do ourselves raise such errors.
* Standalone: Avoid also the “_crypt” standard library extension module, and make the `crypt` module raise an error where we modify the message to not be as misleading.
* Standalone: On macOS we also saw `_bisect`, `_opcode` and more modules that are optional extension modules, that we no longer do automatically use if they are that way.
* Standalone: Added more modules like `mailbox`, `grp`, etc. to exclusion from standard library when they trigger dependencies on other things, or are an extension themselves.
* Anti-Bloat: Avoid using `sqlalchmy.testing` and therefore `pytest` in `sqlalchemy` package. Also added that testing package to be treated as using `pytest`. Added in 1.7.10 already.
* Anti-Bloat: Avoid IPython in `distributed` package. Added in 1.7.10 already.
* Anti-Bloat: Avoid `dask` usage in `skimage`. Added in 1.7.10 already.
* Anti-Bloat: More changes needed for newer `sympy` to avoid `IPython`. Added in 1.7.10 already.
* Anti-Bloat: Enhanced handling of `PIL.ImageQt` even without the Qt binding plugins being active.
* Anti-Bloat: Do not automatically follow `matplotlib` from `scipy` as that is code that will only be used if other code using it exists too.
* Anti-Bloat: Avoid `pandas` and `matplotlib` for `sklearn` package. Availability checks of third party packages should be counted as real usage.
* Anti-Bloat: Avoid `IPython` in newer `keras` module too.
* Anti-Bloat: Updated for newer `tensorflow` package, also using more robust new form of `no-auto-follow` to achieve that.
* Anti-Bloat: Avoid using Qt bindings for `pandas.io.clipboard` as it’s only useful if one of our Qt plugins is active.

## Organisational

* User Manual: Make it clear in the example that renaming created extension modules to change their name does not work, such that the user has to first rename the Python module properly.
* macOS: Pronounce Homebrew as somewhat support but not recommended due to its limited results for portability.
* UI: Added mnemonic for unsupported Windows store Python, so we have a place to give more information. Read more on [the info page](https://nuitka.net/info/unsupported-windows-app-store-python.html) for detailed information.
* UI: Disable warning for `numpy`/`scipy` DLL non-identity conflicts. These are very common unfortunately and known to be harmless.
* Stop creating PDFs for release. They are not really needed, but cause extra effort that makes no sense.
* Quality: Updated to latest black which removes some leading new lines in blocks, changing a bunch of files. Bumped development requirements file Python version to 3.8, since black won’t do 3.7 anymore.
* Quality: Updated to latest PyLint, no changes from that.
* Quality: Auto-format the markdown files used for GitHub templates as well.
* Debugging: Catch errors during data composer phase cleaner. Added in 1.7.1 already.
* Plugins: More clear error messages for Yaml files checker. Added in 1.7.5 already.
* Release: Avoid DNS lookup by container, these sometimes failed.
* UI: Catch user error of compiling in module mode with unknown file kinds, it needs to be Python code of course.
* UI: In case of `SyntaxError` in main file, always suggest latest supported version. Previous it was toggling between Python2 and Python3, but that’s no longer the main reason this happens.
* UI: Fix typo in help output for `--trademarks` option. Added in 1.7.8 already.
* UI: Fix, need to enforce version information completeness only on Windows, other platforms can be more forgiving. Added in 1.7.8 already.
* Visual Code: Enable black formatter as default for Python.
* UI: Disallow `--follow-stdlib` with `--standalone` mode. This is now the default, and just generally makes no sense anymore.
* Plugins: Warn if Qt qml plugins are not included, but qml files are. This has been a trap for first time users for a while now, that now have a way of knowing that they need to enable that Qt plugin feature.
* Plugins: Enhanced Qt binding plugins selection by the various qt plugins
  Now can also ask to not include specified plugins with `--noinclude-qt-plugins` and by now include `sensible` by default, with the `--include-qt-plugins=qml` line not replacing it, but rather extending it. That makes it easier to handle and catches a common trap, where users would only specify the missing plugin, but remove required plugins like `platform` making it stop to work.
* Plugins: Allow plugins provide `None` for flags not just by return value length, but also an explicit value, so plugin code can make a difference in a consistent way.
* UI: Lets have the `options-nanny` output the failed condition, so it’s more clear what the issue is.
* Quality: Unified spell checker markers to same form in all files through auto-format for more consistency.
* Quality: Always avoid attempting to format executables, much like we already do for bytecode, otherwise some attempts on them can crash.
* Windows: Only change directory to short path during execution of Scons, we are otherwise leaking it to `--run` execution in tests, giving their output comparison a harder time than necessary.
* Scons: Use report paths for outputs of filenames in slow compilation messages as well.
* WinPython: Adapted detection of this flavor to changes made in that project.

## Cleanups

* Major Cleanup, do not treat technical modules special anymore
  Previously the immediate demotion of standard library to bytecode is not really needed and prevented dependency analysis. We have had plenty issues with that ever since not all stdlib modules were automatic anymore, there was a risk of missing some of them, just because this analysis was not done.
  Moved the import detection code to a dedicated module cleaning up the size of the standalone mechanics, as it also is not exclusive to it.
  Adding “reasons” to modules, different from “decision reasons” why something was allowed to be included, these give the technical reason why something is added. This is needed for anti-bloat to be able to ignore stdlib being added only for being frozen.
  Now we are correctly annotating why an extension module was included, e.g. is it technical or not, that solves a TODO we had.
  Removes a lot of code duplication for reading source and bytecode of modules and the separate handling of uncompiled modules as a category in the module registry is no more necessary.
  The detection logic for technical modules itself was apparently not robust and had bugs to be fixed that became visible now, and that make it unclear how it ever worked as well.
* Refactor towards unification of statement and expression.
  Make sure Make existing statement operations, i.e. use the function intended for them so they are immediately closer to what expressions do, and don’t visit their own children themselves anymore.
  Remove checks for expression or statement, we won’t use that anymore, and it’s only costing performance until we merge them.
* The caching (currently only used when demoting to bytecode), was not keeping track of distributions attempted to be used, but then being not found. That could have led to errors when using the cached result.
* Again some more spelling fixes in code were identified and fixed.
* Removed now unused user provided flag from uncompiled module nodes.
* Removed 3.3 support from test runner as well.
* Avoid potential slur word from one of the tests.

## Tests

* Sometimes the pickle from cached CPython executions cannot be read due to protocol version differences, then of course it’s also not usable.
* Added CPython311 test suite, but it is not yet completely integrated.
* Tests: Salvage one test for `dateutil` from a GSoC 2019 PR, we can use that.

## Summary

This is massive in terms of new features supported. The deployment mode being added, provides us with a framework to make new user experience with e.g. the missing data files, much more generous and help them by pointing to the right solution.

The technical debt of immediate bytecode demotion being removed, is huge for reliability of Nuitka. We now really only have to deal with actual hidden dependencies in stdlib, and not just ones caused by us trying to exclude parts of it and missing internal dependencies.
